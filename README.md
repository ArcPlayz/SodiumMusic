Clone the repo, install required packages and after configuration run the 'SodiumMusic.py' file.

## Configuration
Just fill the 'config.sm' file with correct values.
### Effects
Effects in config are the ffmpeg's -af parameter. If the effect doesn't affect the playback speed, you just have to include it as a string. Ex.:
	
	'8d': 'apulsator = hz = 0.125'

Otherwise you must include it's factor as a second tuple element:

	'nightcore': ('asetrate = 48000 * 1.25', 1.25)

## ToDo:
- implementation of the 'back' command

### Known problems:
- Titles of Soundcloud playlist entries are not available in the queue preview because of this issue: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/1871
- Some tracks from Spotify playlists (with indexes over 100) are being returned incorrectly (non-existing in playlist instead of correct ones)
